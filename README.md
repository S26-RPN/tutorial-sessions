# Assignment Template

This repo contains the starter code and infrastructure for the assignment. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment and submit your work.

> [!NOTE]
> **Questions**: The PDF containing all question statements can be found in the [assets](./assets/) directory.

## 1. Setup
- Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (one-time setup). 

- Initialize the environment to setup Python 3.10, followed by required libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, CasADi, CVXPY):

  ```sh
  git clone <REPO_URL> && cd <REPO>
  make setup      # runs `uv sync`
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

## 2. Solutions

The repo is organized into directories for each question. Each directory contains a `src/` folder where you must place your implementation. 

**Runnable Requirement & Output**

- Before submitting, ensure your solution is fully functional and can be executed via the provided entry point: `python qX_question_name/main.py`
- All multimedia files (images, graphs, videos, etc.) generated by your code MUST be saved inside the [assets](./assets/) directory, organized by question.

**Authorized Modifications:**

- Files inside any `src/` directory only
- `config.yaml` within each question directories.

> [!CAUTION]
**Immutable Files & Integrity:** All files and scripts outside of `src/` (except `config.yaml`) are meant to be immutable. Modifying infra scripts (such as `main.py`, `visualizer.py`, or GitHub workflows) will trigger **Integrity Violations** (check [RULES](#rules) section) and block your submission.


## 3. Submission Workflow

1. **Verify Code Quality**: Run the linter to detect unused imports and logic errors
    ```sh
    make check
    ```

2. **Auto-Fix Issues**: Auto-repair formatting and minor syntax mistakes
    ```sh
    make fix
    ```

3. **Validate Rules**: Check against course constraints (line counts, file limits, and asset sizes)
    ```
    make validate
    ```

4. **Submit**: Stage and push your changes to the remote repository.
    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "<COMMIT-MSG>"
    git push
    ```
## RULES

Your submission is auto-validated against the following constraints. Failure to meet these will result in a failed build on GitHub. 

- **Script Count**: Maximum of 5 Python scripts allowed per `src/` directory
- **Script Length**: Maximum of 500 lines of code per script
- **Integrity**: Modifications are forbidden outside `src/` (except `config.yaml`)
- **Assets**: PDF, Image, or Video files must NOT exceed 5 MB each

> Bypassing local hooks with `--no-verify` will be caught and blocked by the GitHub Actions Compliance runner
